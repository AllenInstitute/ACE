  <h2>Visualizations and statistics</h2>
  <p>This section includes a series of visualizations and statistics for comparison of the annotations included in the data set selected or provided above in "Select data set", for the set of cells selected in "Filter cells in dataset".  More detail is included in the <a href="https://github.com/AllenInstitute/ACE/blob/dev/ACE_User_Guide.pdf">User Guide</a>, but a brief summary of each panel is included below. Options for modifying or downloading most plots and data are available within each panel.</p>
  <p><i>For some panels, calculations are performed upon any state change in the app so we recommend adjusting the data set and filter set while this panel is showing.</i></p>
  <h3>Compare pairs of annotations</h3>
  <p>This panel shows different plots depending on the data type. When comparing categorgial variables (most cases), a confusion matrix is shown where points can be sized or colored in a variety of ways, including based on Jaccard distance (default). For numeric values either a box-and-whiskers + dot plot (when comparing with a categorical variable) or a scatter plot (when comparing two numeric values) is shown. <i>If 2D coordinates (e.g., UMAP or spatial) are provided, they can be displayed in this panel.</i></p>
  <h3>Link 2+ annotations (river plots)</h3>
  <p>This panel shows a river plot (also called a 'Sankey plot' or 'Sankey diagram') which chains together relationships between two or more categorical variables. The order variables are listed matters, as the overlap between each pair of adjacent annotations are shown.</p>
  <h3>Explore individual annotations</h3>
  <p>This tab focuses on exploring individual annotations (e.g., the "subclass" called "SST"). It matched plots and graphs showing all values of different annotations for a given input annotation, as well as set of additional metadata for any annotation value selected from the table. <i>This is the only place that the "Location of metadata (e.g., cluster) infomration" file is used.</i></p>
