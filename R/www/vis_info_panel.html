  <h2>Visualizations and statistics</h2>
  <p>This section includes a series of visualizations and statistics for comparison of the annotations included in the data set selected or provided above in "Select data set", for the set of cells selected in "Filter cells in dataset".  More detail is included in the <a href="https://github.com/AllenInstitute/ACE/blob/dev/ACE_User_Guide.pdf">User Guide</a>, but a brief summary of each panel is included below. Options for modifying or downloading most plots and data are available within each panel. <i>Note that only relevant panels are shown for each data set provided above. All panels are shown for user-provided data sets.</i></p>
  <p><b><i>For some panels, calculations are performed upon any state change in the app so we recommend adjusting the data set and filter set while this panel is showing.</i></b></p>
  <h3>Compare pairs of annotations</h3>
  <p>This panel shows different plots depending on the data type. When comparing categorical variables (most cases), a confusion matrix is shown where points can be sized or colored in a variety of ways, including based on Jaccard distance (default). When comparing numeric vs. categorical values a box-and-whiskers + dot plot is shown. An example of this would be in viewing mapping probabilities for each cell type. Comparisons of pairs of numeric annotations is done in a separate panel. </p>
  <h3>Link 2+ annotations (river plots)</h3>
  <p>This panel shows a river plot (also called a 'Sankey plot' or 'Sankey diagram') which chains together relationships between two or more categorical variables. The order variables are listed matters, as the overlap between each pair of adjacent annotations are shown.</p>
  <h3>Explore individual annotations</h3>
  <p>This tab focuses on exploring individual annotations (e.g., the "subclass" called "SST"). It matched plots and graphs showing all values of different annotations for a given input annotation, as well as set of additional metadata for any annotation value selected from the table. <i>This is the only place that the "Location of metadata (e.g., cluster) information" file is used.</i></p>
  <h3>Compare numeric annotations</h3>
  <p>This tab focuses on comparing pairs of numeric annotations. Two common use cases are (1) visualizing 2D UMAP coordinates and (2) showing spatial positions of cells in a MERFISH tissue section. Cells are visualized using an interactive scatter plot with hover capabilities.</p>
